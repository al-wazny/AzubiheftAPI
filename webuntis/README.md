# WebUntis API Wrapper

## Description

This is a high level wrapper / api client to interact with the WebUntis API.  
The main purpose is to get the topics of the lessons you had.    
This is my first time writing python so mistakes can happen.

## How to use

Please take a look at the `webuntis_example.py` file on how to use the api wrapper.
